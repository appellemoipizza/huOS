\# roadmap



huos started as a structured architecture prototype inside notion.



the objective was to validate the data model and pillar structure before building a local runtime.



once the ontology proved stable, the system moved to sqlite and python for full local execution.



---



\## phase 1 — local stabilization (current)



\- migrate from notion to sqlite

\- finalize entry schema

\- enforce ai output contract

\- implement safe schema migrations

\- stabilize capture loop

\- confirm deterministic writes

\- configure wal journaling and local backups



focus: stability and reliability.

\## phase 2 — observability (current)



\- expand statistical introspection

\- improve pillar distribution analysis

\- detect temporal trends

\- surface recurring signals (emotion, activity, imbalance)



focus: making stored data measurable and interpretable.



---



\## phase 3 — structured reflection



\- weekly recap summaries

\- cross-pillar imbalance detection

\- recurring pattern detection

\- abandoned goal detection

\- intention vs execution tracking



ai becomes more useful as dataset density increases.



all processing remains local.



---



\## phase 4 — interface improvements



\- structured dashboard view

\- pillar → entry drill-down navigation

\- timeline navigation

\- optional experimental spatial visualization layer



focus: improving accessibility without increasing system complexity.



---



\## long-term direction



\- embedding-based search

\- similarity clustering

\- automated insight suggestions

\- improved statistical modeling



any expansion must respect:



\- no breaking schema changes

\- additive evolution only

\- local-first execution

\- ai remains assistive, not autonomous
